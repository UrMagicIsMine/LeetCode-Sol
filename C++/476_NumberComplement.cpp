/* Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy
* is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
*
* Note:
* The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
* You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
* Example 1:
* Input: 5
* Output: 2
* Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and
* its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
* Example 2:
* Input: 1
* Output: 0
* Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and
* its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
