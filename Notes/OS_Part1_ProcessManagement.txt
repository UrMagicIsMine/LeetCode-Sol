----------------------          Ch 3 Process            ------------------------

Process Concept
1) process: text section + current activity (program counter, registers, process
stack, data section, heap, etc.)
2) Process state: New/Running/Waiting/Ready/terminated
3) Process control block: process state/Program counter/CPU registers/CPU-scheduling
information/Memory-management information(base/limit register, segment/page table)/
Accounting information/IO status information

Process Scheduling
1) Scheduling Queues:
  - ready queues: ready and waiting to execute
  - device queue: wait for a particular I/O device
2) I/O-bound and CPU-bound process
3) context switch perform a state save of the current process and a state restore
of a different process (typically cost a few milliseconds);

Operations on Processes
1) unique process identifier (pid);
2) when a process create a new process:
  - parent execute concurrently with its children;
  - parent waits until its children have terminated;
  - address-space (duplicate of the parent/new program loaded into it)
3) process termination: all the resources (physical/virtual memory, open files
and IO buffers) are deallocated by the OS.
4) parent may terminate child: 1) child exceed usage of resources; 2) task is no
longer required; 3) parent is existing (cascading termination)
5) zombie (terminated but parent not call wait yet)/orphans (parent exist)

Inter-process communication
1) Process independent/cooperating, reasons for cooperation: information sharing/
computation speedup/modularity/convenience
2) IPC mechanism:
  - shared memory: faster, suffers from cache coherency issues, process need to
  ensure they are not writing to the same location simultaneously;
  - message passing: exchange smaller amount of data, easier to implement in
  distributed system, implement use system call;

Examples of IPC Systems
1) POSIX shared memory is organized using memory-mapped files (associate the region
of shared memory with a file);

Communication in Client-Server System
1) A pair of processes communicating over a network employs a pair of socket (
identified by an IP address with a port number)
  - Connection-oriented (TCP) socket vs Connectionless (UDP) sockets;
  - Common and efficient, low-level unstructured stream of bytes;
2) RPC communication data are well structured
  - Message is addressed to an RPC daemon listening to a port on remote system
  - Contains an identifier specifying the function to execute and the parameters
  to pass to that function.
  - Executed the function and set back the output.
  - need ensure exactly once using timestamps
3) Pipes acts as a conduit allowing two processes to communicate
  - Ordinary pipes allow communication between parent and child processes;
  - Named pipes permit unrelated processes to communicate.

----------------------          Ch 4 Threads            ------------------------

Overview
1) Thread comprises a thread ID/program counter/register set/stack, it shares
code section/data section and other OS resources(opened files/signals) with other
threads to the same process;
2) Benefits: Responsive/Resource sharing(data and code, several different of thread
activity within the same address space)/economy(creation/context-switch, 30/5
times) and scalability

Multicore Programming
1) Concurrency (switch and illusion) vs parallelism (parallel in different cores)
2) Challenges: 1) identify tasks/balance/data splitting/data dependency(synchronize)
/testing and debugging
3) Type of parallelism
  - Data parallelism focuses on distributing subsets of the same data across multiple
  computing cores and performing the same operation on each core
  - Task parallelism: distributing tasks, perform a unique operation

Multithreading Models
1) Threads may be provided either at user level (user thread), or by the kernel,
for kernel threads. Relationship between them can be Many-to-One model/One-to-One
model/Many-to-Many model.
2) The POSIX standard, may be provided as either a user-level or a kernel-level
library.
3) Asynchronous threading: each thread runs independently for every other thread,
and the parent thread need not know when its child terminates;
4) Synchronous threading occurs when the parent thread creates one or more children
and then must wait for all of its children to terminate (fork-join strategy);
5) Unlimited threads could exhaust system resources --> use thread pool
  - create a number of threads at process startup and place them into a pool;
  - receive a request/awakens a thread from the pool(if available)/process the
  request/returns to the pool/no available thread? must wait.
  - fast/limits the number of threads/separating performing the task from creating;

Threading Issues
1) two versions of fork: one that duplicates all threads and another duplicates
only the thread that invoked the fork system call
2) Signal: used in UNIX system to notify a process that a particular event occurred
  - Synchronous signals are delivered to the same process
  - Asynchronous signals is not as clear, some should be sent to all threads
3) Thread Cancellation: Invoking pthread_cancel()indicates only a request to cancel
the target thread, however; actual cancellation depends on how the target thread
is set up to handle the request.
  - Asynchronous cancellation: immediately termination (may not free a necessary
  system-wide resource, data conflict, etc.)
  - Deferred cancellation: perform this check at a point at which it can be cancelled
4) Thread-local storage: static data unique to each thread


----------------------  Ch 5 Process Synchronization    ------------------------
Background
1) Process outcome depends on the order of execution (race condition)

The Critical-Section Problem
1) critical section/entry section/exit section/remainder section
2) Mutual exclusion/Progress/Bounded waiting
  - Preemptive kernels: (responsive/suitable for real-time programming)
  - Non-preemptive kernels:(exits kernel mode/yields control of CPU)
Peterson’s Solution

Synchronization Hardware
1) Could be solved simply in a single-processor environment if we could prevent
interrupts from occurring, not suitable for SMP()
2) Many modern computer systems therefore provide special hardware instructions
that allow us either to test and modify the content of a word or to swap the
contents of two words atomically -> to implement lock

Mutex Lock
1) A mutex lock has a boolean variable available whose value indicates if the lock
is available or not.
2) Busy-waiting/spinlock
  - wastes CPU cycles/no context switch/often employed in SMP

Semaphores
1) A semaphore S is an integer variable that, apart from initialization, is accessed
only through two standard atomic operations: wait() and signal().
2) Counting semaphores can be used to control access to a given resource consisting
of finite number of instances;
3) Semaphores initialized to the number of resource available; Each process perform
a wait on the semaphore(decrementing the count); when a process release a resource,
it performs a signal() operation (increment the count); if the count goes to 0,
wait will block until the count greater than 0; Operations must executed atomically
5) Deadlocks V.S. indefinite blocking or starvation V.S. priority inversion
  - two or more processes are waiting indefinitely for an event that can be caused
  by only one of the waiting processes.
  - a situation in which processes wait indefinitely within the semaphore
Monitors

Synchronization in Linux
1) atomic operations do not require the overhead of locking mechanisms;
2) SMP, the fundamental locking is a spinlock, kernel make sure hold it for short
3) Single process, disable kernel preemption
4) for long time lock, use mutex lock/Semaphores

----------------------       Ch 4 CPU Scheduling        ------------------------

Basic Concept
1) CPU burst/IO burst (durations of CPU bursts: exponential distribution)
2) non-preemptive/preemptive (responsive/race condition)
3) Dispatcher(context switch/switch to the user mode/start another running) latency

Scheduling Criteria
1) CPU utilization: keep it as busy as possible;
2) Throughput: #processes complete per time unit
3) Turnaround time: sum of all time (time to execute that process)
4) Waiting time: sum of all time spent waiting in the ready queue
5) Response time: time it takes to start responding

Scheduling Algorithms
1) FCFS - simple to write/long average waiting time/non-preemptive
2) SJF - optimal in minimum average waiting time/difficult to know the length of
next CPU request/can be either preemptive or non-preemptive
3) Priority-scheduling
  - Priorities can be defined either internally or externally (or political factors)
  - can be preemptive or non-preemptive
  - indefinite blocking or starvation (solve using aging)
4) Round-Robin Scheduling
  - long average waiting time
  - preemptive as unfinished job will be put back in the ready queue
  - each process must wait no longer than (n-1) * q time
  - performance depends on time quantum (degrade to FCFS/too many context switches)
5) Multilevel Queue Scheduling
  - background and foreground processes each has its own scheduling algorithm
  - system/interactive/interactive editing/Batch/Student processes
6) Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling
  - allow a process move between queues

Thread Scheduling
1) Contention Scope
  - process-contention scope : competition for the CPU takes place among threads
  belonging to the same process.
  - system-contention scope: competition takes place among all threads in the
  system (Windows/Linux/Solaris schedule threads using only SCS.)

Multiple-Processor Scheduling
1) Loading sharing/homogenous(process identical)
2) symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), each processor is self-scheduling
  - may be in a common ready queue OR each processor have its own queue
3) Process affinity (cache invalid) - process has affinity for the processor
  - soft vs. hard affinity/non-uniform memory access
4) Load balance - keep the workload evenly distributed across all processors
  - push migration (check/give) and pull migration(active request)
  - often counteracts the benefits of processor affinity
5) Multicore Processors - place multiple processor cores on the same physical chip
  - faster/comsume less power
  - memory stall(cache miss), switch to different core
  - two levels of scheduling(operating level and core level)

Real-Time CPU Scheduling
1) Soft v.s. Hard real-time system
  - Interrupt latency: arrival of an interrupt -> determine the type of interrupt
  -> save the state of current process -> start of the services routine
  - Dispatch latency: stop one process -> start another (provide preemptive kernels)
2) Typical scheduling
  - Priority-based algorithm with preemption
  - Earliest-Deadline-First Scheduling
  - Proportional Share Scheduling

Operating-System Examples (Linux)
1) Default use complete fair scheduling (CFS) algorithms
  - nice value range from -20 to + 19, be nice to others by lowering its nice value
  - virtual run time: atomic adjustment based on priority, the scheduler simply
  selects the task that has the smallest v-runtime value. (nice to I/O-bound task)

Algorithm Evaluation
1) Deterministic modeling: takes a particular predetermined workload and defines
the performance of algorithm
2) Simulations: generated data to drive simulation (uniform, exponential, Poisson)
or empirically.
3) implement algorithm on actual system and monitor its performance in real-world

----------------------          Ch 4 Deadlocks          ------------------------

System Model
1) Process may utilize a resource in only the following sequence: Request/Use/Release
2) Developers of multithreaded application must remain aware of the possibility
of deadlocks.
Deadlock Characterization
1) A deadlock situation can arise if four conditions hold simultaneously
  - Mutual exclusion/Hold and wait/No preemption for resource/Circular wait
2) Resource-Allocation Graph
  - process(circle), resource (rectangle), dot, request edge, assignment edge
  - each resource has exactly one instance, cycle implies deadlock
  - multi-instance, not necessarily

Methods for Handling Deadlock
1) Deadlock prevention
2) Deadlock allow/detect/recover
3) ignore and pretend it never occur (used by most OS)

Deadlock Prevention (low device utilization and reduced system throughput)
1) Mutual Exclusion: cannot prevent deadlock by denying mutex condition
2) Hold and wait: request and be allocated all its resources before execution
  - low resource utilization/starvation is possible
3) No Preemption: all resources the process is currently holding are preempted
  - only apply to CPU registers and memory space, not mutex locks and semaphores
4) Circular Wait: Each process can request resources only in an increasing order
of enumeration. (proof by contradiction)

Deadlock Avoidance
1) Consider resource available, allocated, future request and release
2) Safe State: can allocate resources to each process and still avoid a deadlock
  - granted only if the allocation leaves the system in a safe state
3) Resource-Allocation-Graph Algorithm (only one instance of each resource)
  - introduce request edge (dash line)
  - request granted only if converting request edge to assignment doesn't result
  in cycle
4) Banker’s Algorithm (multiple instances of each resource type)
  -
Deadlock Detection
1) Single instance of each resource type
  - remove the resource nodes and collapsing the appropriate edges
  - invoke an algorithm that search for a cycle
2) Multiple instances of each resource type
  -
3) Detection-Algorithm Usage
  - how often a deadlock likely to occur/how many processes will be affected
  - invoke detection algorithm for every resource request/at defined intervals

Recovery from Deadlock
1) Process Termination
  - Abort all deadlocked processes
  - Abort one process at a time until the deadlock cycle is eliminated
2) Resource Preemption
  - successively preempt some resources from processes until deadlock cycle is broken
  - selecting a victim/Rollback/Starvation
