Paxos Made Simple, Leslie Lamport

The Consensus Algorithm
1) Problem and Requirement: safety requirements for consensus are to ensure that
some proposed value is eventually chosen and if a value has been chosen, then a
process can eventually learn the value;
2) Performed by three classes of agents: Proposers, Acceptors and Learners
3) Messages sent use customary asynchronous, non-Byzantine model:
 - Agents operate at arbitrary speed, may fail by stopping and may restart
 - Messages can take arbitrarily long to be delivered, can be duplicated and
 can be lost, but they are not corrupted;

Implementation
