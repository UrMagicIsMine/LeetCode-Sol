----------------------           PR 4 Spanner           ------------------------
Abstract/Introduction

1) Spanner is Google's scalable, multi-version, globally-distributed and synchr-
onously-replicated database
2) novel time API that exposes clock uncertainty
  - non-blocking reads in the past/ lock-free read-only transactions/atomic
  scheme changes
3) database shards data across many sets of Paxos state machine in data-centers
spread all over the world.
4) Replication is used for global availability and geographic locality
  - clients automatically failover between replicas
  - Spanner automatically reshards data across machines as the data/server changes
  - Spanner automatically migrates data across machine/datacenters to load balance
5) data is versioned and timestamped with its commit time, old versions of data
are subject to configurable garbage-collection policy
6) Support general-purpose transactions and provide a SQL-based query language
7) Features supported
  - replication configurations for data can be dynamically controlled at a fine
  grain;
  - provide externally consistent reads and writes, globally-consistent reads
  across the database;
  - new TrueTime API (expose clock uncertainty and slow-down to wait out that
  uncertainty/keep uncertainty small by using multiple model clock reference)

Implementation

1) Terminology
  - Universe: a spanner deployment;
    - universe master and the placement driver are singletons, universe master
    is a console of all zones status for debugging, placement dirvers handles
    automated movement of data across zones on the timescale of minutes
  - Zones: analog of Bigtable server, unit of physical isolation
    - one zone-master and 100+/1K+ span-server
    - location proxies: locate the spanservers to serve the data
  - directory: used to manage replication and locality, unit of data movement
